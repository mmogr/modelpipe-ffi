//! The one tokio runtime this library owns, and the adapter every async
//! export runs its body in.
//!
//! An app links a static library and calls a function; there is no
//! `#[tokio::main]` anywhere above it, and `UniFFI` polls an exported future
//! inline, on whichever Swift thread awaits it, with no tokio context. So the
//! library owns one runtime, lazily, for the life of the process. That is the
//! right lifetime for it — a pipe outlives any single call, and modelpipe
//! spawns the dial, the path watcher and the forwarding loop onto whatever
//! runtime is current while `connect` is polled. A per-call runtime would be
//! dropped the moment `connect` returned, taking those tasks with it.
//!
//! [`in_runtime`] is what makes it current. It enters this runtime for every
//! poll of a call's body and for the body's drop, so the body runs on the
//! calling thread while what it spawns, and the timers and sockets it
//! registers, run on this runtime's two workers.

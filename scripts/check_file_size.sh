# Rust file-size gate: no source file over the budget of code lines.
#
# Usage: ./scripts/check_file_size.sh [--update | --self-test]
#
# The gate exists so that a file's logic can be read in one sitting. Prose
# is not logic, so a `//` comment or doc line does not spend the budget; how
# much prose a file carries is a question for review, not for this gate. A
# line counts unless it is blank or its first non-space characters are `//`,
# which covers `///` and `//!` docs as well as plain comments. A code line
# with a comment after it counts. The rule reads one line at a time and does
# not parse Rust, so it applies unchanged inside a `/* */` block or a
# multi-line string: there too a blank or `//`-led line is free and every
# other line counts like code.
#
# The rule is checked against a fixture of one-line cases before every run,
# so whichever awk runs the gate, on a CI runner or a laptop, is held to the
# same count. --self-test runs that check alone.
#
# Adapted from gglib's check_rust_complexity.sh, which is a *ratchet* —
# files already over budget may shrink but not grow — and says why: 175
# files were over the line when it was written, so "a hard gate would fail
# on every commit and be switched off within a day, which is how a
# constraint becomes decorative."
#
# This workspace has no such debt. Every file is under budget today, so it
# can have the hard gate that one wanted, and a file crossing the line is a
# failure rather than a new baseline entry. The constraint that produces is
# not "write less" but "decompose by responsibility" — a file at the limit is
# telling you it holds more than one thing.
#
# --update writes a baseline recording the current over-budget files, and is
# the deliberate escape hatch for the case where a file legitimately has to
# grow. It is shipped, and the baseline is NOT committed: the hatch exists so
# that the first genuine 340-line state machine does not get the whole gate
# commented out, and using it creates a new tracked file in the diff — a
# reviewable event, rather than a silent edit to a list nobody reads.
#
# Tests do not count. A `*_tests.rs` sibling exists precisely so that a module
# can be thoroughly tested without its tests consuming the budget meant for
# its implementation; charging them against it would make the gate argue for
# fewer tests, which is the opposite of the point.

# Rust file-size gate: no source file over the budget.
#
# Usage: ./scripts/check_file_size.sh [--update]
#
# Adapted from gglib's check_rust_complexity.sh, with the one change its own
# header argues for. That script is a *ratchet* — files already over budget
# may shrink but not grow — and it says why: 175 files were over the line
# when it was written, so "a hard gate would fail on every commit and be
# switched off within a day, which is how a constraint becomes decorative."
#
# This workspace has no such debt. Every file is under budget today, so it
# can have the hard gate that one wanted, and a file crossing the line is a
# failure rather than a new baseline entry. The constraint that produces is
# not "write less" but "decompose by responsibility" — a file at the limit is
# telling you it holds more than one thing.
#
# --update writes a baseline recording the current over-budget files, and is
# the deliberate escape hatch for the case where a file legitimately has to
# grow. It is shipped, and the baseline is NOT committed: the hatch exists so
# that the first genuine 340-line state machine does not get the whole gate
# commented out, and using it creates a new tracked file in the diff — a
# reviewable event, rather than a silent edit to a list nobody reads.
#
# Tests do not count. A `*_tests.rs` sibling exists precisely so that a module
# can be thoroughly tested without its tests consuming the budget meant for
# its implementation; charging them against it would make the gate argue for
# fewer tests, which is the opposite of the point.

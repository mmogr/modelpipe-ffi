# checks badge module paths this repo has no equivalent of).
#
# GitHub rejects a workflow file containing a duplicate key outright: the run is
# marked "failed because of a workflow file issue" and NO jobs start. That makes
# it invisible to CI itself — a broken ci.yml cannot run the job that would have
# caught it — so this check has to happen before the push.
#
# Most YAML parsers won't help: the spec says duplicate keys are invalid, but
# Psych's safe_load and PyYAML both silently keep the last one. Walking the raw
# node tree is what makes them visible.

ruby -ryaml -e '# encoding: utf-8
#
# Load-bearing, and the first line for a reason: ruby takes the encoding of
# a -e script from the locale, so under LC_ALL=C or a bare POSIX default it
# is US-ASCII and the two glyphs below are a SyntaxError before a single
# workflow file is read. Setting -E utf-8 or RUBYOPT does not fix it: those
# set the external and internal encodings, not the encoding of the script
# itself. Measured — without this line,
# `LC_ALL=C ./scripts/check_workflow_yaml.sh` dies with
# "invalid multibyte char (US-ASCII)" and exits 1, so `make pre-commit`
# fails on any machine whose locale is not already UTF-8. GitHub runners
# set LANG=C.UTF-8, which is why this hid from CI.
#
# Note this whole script is a single-quoted shell string, so it must contain
# no apostrophe anywhere.
